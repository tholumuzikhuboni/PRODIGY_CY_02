# Image Encryption Tool

This project is a Python-based tool that encrypts and decrypts images using pixel manipulation. It was developed as part of my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy Infotech.

## Features
- **Encryption**: Applies a mathematical transformation to image pixels for confidentiality.
- **Decryption**: Reverses the transformation to retrieve the original image.
- **Customizable Key**: Users can specify an integer key for encryption and decryption.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pillow**: Library for image processing.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed.
- Install the Pillow library using:
  ```bash
  pip install pillow
